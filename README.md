Feature Name: Custom Tip Allocation
Goal:
Allow customers to control how their tip is distributed among restaurant staff (e.g., server, kitchen, bar), adding transparency and fairness.
User Flow:
1.	Customer finishes meal and receives payment screen.
2.	After choosing a tip amount, a new screen/step appears:
‚ÄúWould you like to customize how your tip is shared?‚Äù
3.	User selects a preset or adjusts sliders.
4.	System stores the allocation and forwards it to the payroll/tip distribution engine.

A feature that allows customers to decide how their tip is split among employees ‚Äî not just the server, but optionally including kitchen staff, bartenders, hosts, etc.
 
Is This Feature Already Present Anywhere?
Yes, but rarely in a user-facing way. Here‚Äôs what currently exists:
‚Ä¢	Back-of-house allocation is typically done by management or set rules in the POS system (e.g., 70% to servers, 20% to kitchen, 10% to hosts).
‚Ä¢	Toast, Square, and Upserve have limited tip-pooling features, but these are not customizable by the customerduring payment.
‚Ä¢	Apps like Tippy or Gratuity Solutions cater more to salons and service businesses than restaurants.
The idea ‚Äî empowering customers to decide ‚Äî is a novel front-end feature and could be presented during digital checkout or tablet-based ordering.
 
Pros of This Feature
Benefit	Description
Transparency-Customers feel empowered and informed about where their money is going.
Employee Morale-Kitchen and support staff may feel more appreciated when included.
Fairness-Encourages more equitable distribution beyond just the front-line staff.
Customer Experience-Some diners may feel more loyal to a place that values all roles.
Customization-Could allow presets (e.g., ‚Äúeven split,‚Äù ‚Äú70/30,‚Äù ‚Äúserver only,‚Äù etc.) for ease of use.
 
Cons or Risks
Complex UX-Too many choices at checkout can confuse or delay customers.
Operational Conflicts-Could conflict with restaurant policies, union rules, or legal requirements.
Staff Resentment-Servers might be upset if customers reduce their share of tips.
Accounting Complexity-Custom splits create complications for payroll and reporting.
Inconsistent Use-Some customers may misuse or misunderstand the feature.
 
Feature Enhancement Ideas
‚Ä¢	Preset Options:
o	"Server Only"
o	"Even Split (Front + Back of House)"
o	"Custom Allocation"
‚Ä¢	Default Setting with Option to Edit:
Makes it easier for customers who don‚Äôt want to think too hard.
‚Ä¢	Visual Explanation:
Small icons or pop-ups showing how roles contribute to the service.
 
How It Could Work (Theoretically)
If this feature were to integrate with an existing app like Square, Toast, or Clover, it could:
1.	Hook into the payment screen.
2.	Add an optional step before payment confirmation.
3.	Capture tip split percentages and associate them with the ticket.
4.	Pass this data into payroll or the tip-distribution engine for backend processing.

Core Options:
‚Ä¢	Preset buttons:
o	‚ÄúServer Only‚Äù
o	‚ÄúEven Split‚Äù
o	‚ÄúCustom Split‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Manual sliders for:
o	Server
o	Kitchen
o	Bar

Business Rules:
‚Ä¢	Tip total must equal 100%.
‚Ä¢	Minimum tip per role can be enforced (optional).
‚Ä¢	Default option can be set by business.
POS Integration Ideas (Toast, Square, etc.)

üçû Toast Integration (Example)
‚Ä¢	Hook into Toast API at the payment step (via their partner program)
‚Ä¢	Use gratuitySettings or tip-related API fields
‚Ä¢	Store tip_split as metadata or send to a webhook for backend processing
‚Ä¢	Apply rules to payroll via Toast Payroll or export
üî≤ Square Integration
‚Ä¢	Integrate into Square Terminal or Square Online Checkout
‚Ä¢	Use Order Custom Attributes to tag tips with role allocations
‚Ä¢	Square's Team Management API can help assign tips to employee profiles
‚Ä¢	Payouts can be automated or exported via Square Payroll or external sync
What Does "Share for Kitchen or Bar" Really Mean?
When a customer chooses to allocate part of their tip to "kitchen" or "bar", it does not typically go to one individual (like "the chef who cooked your steak") ‚Äî instead, it goes to a pooled group based on their department.
Example:
‚Ä¢	You tip $10, and select:
o	50% to Server ‚Üí $5
o	30% to Kitchen ‚Üí $3
o	20% to Bar ‚Üí $2
This split is recorded and then distributed within each group, usually by:
‚Ä¢	Hours worked
‚Ä¢	Role-based weighting
‚Ä¢	Shift participation
The restaurant decides how to divide the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù share among chefs, sous-chefs, and helpers. Same goes for bar staff.
 
2. Who Gets the Kitchen Share?
Short answer: It‚Äôs up to management policies or pre-agreed internal rules.
Common models:
‚Ä¢	Even split among all kitchen staff on that shift
‚Ä¢	Weighted by seniority (e.g., chef gets 50%, others get smaller shares)
‚Ä¢	Split based on time worked during the shift
There‚Äôs rarely any tracking of who made your specific dish ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs a small open kitchen or chef‚Äôs table model (and even then, it‚Äôs complicated).
 
3. Who Gets the Bar Share?
Same concept:
‚Ä¢	If you assign 20% of your tip to the bar, that amount goes into the bar team‚Äôs tip pool for the night.
‚Ä¢	It might be split among the:
o	Bartender who made the drink
o	Barback who stocked and supported
o	Sometimes even bar managers
Again, POS systems don‚Äôt usually track exactly who mixed your drink, unless drinks are logged per bartender (rare outside of nightclubs).



 
So How Do You Build a Smart Feature Around This?
Here‚Äôs what you can do:
Keep it High-Level for Customers
‚Ä¢	Let customers choose general roles: Server, Kitchen, Bar, Host
‚Ä¢	Brief explanation on-screen:
‚ÄúYour tip will be fairly shared among the team members in each role based on their shift hours and responsibilities.‚Äù
Handle the Complexity Internally
‚Ä¢	The restaurant‚Äôs admin panel or config should control:
o	Which roles are included
o	How their share is distributed
o	Whether it's equal, weighted, or time-based
Optional Advanced Feature
If the POS already tracks who made each dish or drink:
‚Ä¢	Use that metadata to reward specific contributors
‚Ä¢	This could be a future enhancement in smaller, tech-forward restaurants (e.g., chef-owned spots)
 
How Wages Compare: Front-of-House vs. Back-of-House
Servers
‚Ä¢	Average total earnings: $20,000‚Äì$31,000/year before taxes.
‚Ä¢	Majority of income (often 60%+) comes from tips.
Kitchen Staff (Line cooks, prep cooks, chefs)
‚Ä¢	Line/Prep cooks: ~$28,000‚Äì$29,000/year.
‚Ä¢	Chefs/Sous-chefs: $50,000‚Äì$57,000 average.

Bartenders
‚Ä¢	Around $30,700‚Äì$39,500/year including tips .
‚Ä¢	May also earn in tips, but often less than servers.
 
2. Who "Owns" the Kitchen or Bar Share?
When a guest allocates a tip to "kitchen" or "bar," they‚Äôre contributing to a pooled fund for that department‚Äînot tipping a specific individual. Distribution within the pool depends on restaurant policy:
‚Ä¢	Percentage-based: e.g., 20% kitchen, 10% bar.
‚Ä¢	Hour-based: rewards based on shift hours.
‚Ä¢	Points or role-weighted systems.
This means the chef, sous-chef, and prep cooks all share the kitchen portion. Bartenders and barbacks split the bar tip.
 
3. Impact on Other Roles: Cleaners, Hosts, Bussers, etc.
Potential for inclusion
‚Ä¢	Some tip pools include additional roles like hosts, bussers, or dishwashers.
‚Ä¢	Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, these roles can join if the employer pays full minimum wage and doesn't take a tip credit.

Risks they may feel excluded if not included
‚Ä¢	If cleaners or bussers aren't part of the pool, they may feel undervalued.
‚Ä¢	Conversely, including them raises complex legal and operational questions, especially about role eligibility and tip-credit rules.
 
4. Benefits of Inclusive Tip Pools
‚Ä¢	Improves kitchen and bar staff fairness‚Äîthey gain visibility-to-earnings parity.
‚Ä¢	Promotes teamwork‚Äîshared tip models can motivate cross-functional support.
‚Ä¢	Simplifies management‚Äîreduces disputes, speeds distribution.
 
5. Challenges & Downsides
‚Ä¢	Server pushback: high performers may feel penalized when splitting tips.
‚Ä¢	Fairness concerns: if splits don't reflect effort, frustration builds.
‚Ä¢	Regulatory complexity: FLSA rules on tipped vs non-tipped roles, tip credits, and legality of inclusion.
‚Ä¢	Overlooked roles: cleaners/maintenance not included may feel overlooked unless explained or included appropriately.
 
6. Recommendations Before Sharing Publicly
1.	Clarify internal policy:
o	Define which roles participate (kitchen staff, bartenders, bussers, etc.).
o	Decide distribution method (percentage, hour, points).
2.	Explain publicly:
o	Let customers know their tip is shared fairly across roles.
o	Emphasize that allocation supports team unity and collective efforts.
3.	Ensure legal compliance:
o	Confirm tip-credit eligibility and wage structure.
o	If including non-traditional roles (e.g., cleaners), verify under state and federal FLSA guidelines.
4.	Prepare empathetic messaging:
o	Acknowledge the challenge for high-performing servers.
o	Offer perks or recognition to maintain morale.
 

Integration Ideas for POS Systems:
For Toast, Square, or Clover POS:
1.	Embed in POS Staff Portal
o	Allow staff to pre-select how tips are split for their shift
o	Save preferences via API and apply to end-of-day settlements
2.	Customer-Facing Tablet at Checkout
o	Enable guest to choose how tips are shared
o	Integrate with POS‚Äôs payment flow using APIs (e.g., Toast Partner Connect)
3.	Auto-Sync to Payroll or Tip Reporting
o	Push allocation data to Toast Payroll or Gusto
o	Automatically log tip splits in compliance reports
4.	Role-Based Configuration
o	POS Admins define eligible roles (kitchen, bar, host, etc.)
o	Rules-driven logic for default splits and overrides
‚Ä¢	Average Tip Percentage:
In the U.S., the average tip tends to range between 15% and 20% of the total bill at restaurants. This can vary by region, restaurant type, and the overall customer experience.
‚Ä¢	Average Tip per Shift:
o	In fine dining establishments, servers can often earn $100‚Äì$300 per shift in tips, depending on the volume of customers.
o	In casual dining, tips may range from $50‚Äì$100 per shift for servers.
o	Bartenders, especially in high-traffic areas or busy bars, can earn $200‚Äì$500 in tips per shift.
‚Ä¢	Monthly Tip Totals:
If a restaurant has 100 customers per day and the average tip per customer is $5, that‚Äôs approximately $500 per day in tips.
Over a month (30 days), this would equate to $15,000 in tips for the restaurant.
For an average mid-sized restaurant, the monthly tip amount can vary:
‚Ä¢	Smaller casual restaurants: $5,000‚Äì$15,000 per month in tips.
‚Ä¢	Larger, high-volume restaurants: $20,000‚Äì$50,000 or more per month in tips.

Final Take
A consumer-facing tip allocation feature can be a strong differentiator‚Äîbringing transparency, fairness, and alignment with modern workplace values. But its success relies on thoughtful design around distribution logic, regulatory compliance, and team communication.
You're not just building a tech feature ‚Äî you're touching labor fairness, team culture, and customer ethics.

The smartest solution balances:
‚Ä¢	Transparency for the guest
‚Ä¢	Flexibility for the restaurant
‚Ä¢	Simplicity in the UX






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
